              Monica&apos;s unique Beach themed spa is 
                 an experience like no other and is an oasis of relaxation. We 
                 perform traditional Chinese massage in a serene environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chinese massage has the functions of restoring physical strength, 
              reducing fatigue, enhancing blood circulation, improving the 
              body&apos;s disease resistance, regulating internal organs, beautifying 
              and losing weight, preventing and curing diseases, and prolonging life. 
              Chinese massage can dilate the capillaries on the surface of the body, 
              increase the nutritional response of the skin, improve the breathing of 
              the skin, facilitate the secretion of sweat glands and sebum on the skin surface, 
              and achieve the purpose of beauty.

              <h3>Foot Massage</h3>
              <p>
                Foot massage can increase the temperature of the feet by stimulating 
                acupuncture points and reflex zones, thereby speeding up the blood flow. 
                The sediments on the soles of the feet will then participate in the 
                circulation of the body again, and metabolic waste will also be excreted 
                from the body. Foot massage can regulate nerves. There are abundant neurons 
                distributed in the feet. By stimulating the plantar reflex zone, the 
                corresponding nerve tissues can be regulated, thereby driving the activity 
                of nerve tissues throughout the body and enhancing and improving the 
                functions of tissues and organs.

              <h3>Body Massage</h3>
              <p>
                <h4>Shiatsu Massage</h4>
                <p>
                    Shiatsu massage emphasizes pressure massage on specific parts such as meridians and acupuncture points,
                    or kneading specific parts to relax deep muscles, so it is not suitable for applying essential oils or lotions.
                    If the skin surface is too slippery, the pressure on the acupoints may be inaccurate, so you can massage directly with your clothes on.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Oil Pressure Massage</h4>
                <p>
                    Oil pressure massage usually adds essential oils or lotions, and the hands are in direct contact with the skin over a large area.
                    This is a massage designed for relaxation. Adding essential oils will make the massage smoother and more comfortable, reducing discomfort.
                    If you use special natural plant essential oils, you can also bring a deeper soothing effect and relax your body and mind.
                    Oil pressure massage requires the person being massaged to take off their clothes and apply an appropriate amount of essential oil
                    to help moisturize the skin and prevent colds. Essential oils have a releasing and stress-relieving effect.
                </p>

              <h3>Chair Massage</h3>
              <p>
                Like table massage, chair massage offers numerous benefits. After a 20-minute chair massage session, clients can expect to see these kinds of results:
              </p>
              <ul class="chair-mass-list">
                <li>Reduced muscle tension & knots</li>
                <li>Deeper breathing</li>
                <li>Headache relief</li>
                <li>Stress reduction</li>
                <li>Increased focus and attention</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              Because of results like these, and its portability, chair massage is a popular option for employers who want to improve productivity or morale.
